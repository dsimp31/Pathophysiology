	<Symptoms>
		<Symptom>Asymptomatic for decades because arteries enlarge at plaque locations, thus there is no affect on blood flow.</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until sufficient narrowing or closure of an artery occurs.</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Marked narrowing can produce chest pain of angine, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, palpitations.</Symptom>
	</Symptoms>
	<Causes>
		<Cause>The artherosclerotic process is not fully understood</Cause>
		<Cause>Initiated by an inflammatory process in the endothelial cells of the blood cell associated with retained low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.</Cause>
	</Causes>
	<RiskFactors>
		<RiskFactor>Diabetes</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor sname="Dyslipoproteinemia">Unhealthy patterns of serum proteins carrying fats and cholesterol</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Tobacco smoking</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Elevated serum C-reactive protein concentrations</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Vitamin B-12 deficiency</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Dietary iodine deficiency</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Hypothyroidism</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Advanced age</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Genetic abnormalities</RiskFactor>

	<Diagnostics>
		<Diagnostic>Angiography</Diagnostic>
		<Diagnostic>Doppler ultrasound of arteries</Diagnostic>
		<Diagnostic>Blood serum levels of HbA1c, hs-CRP, and homocysteine</Diagnostic>
	</Diagnostics>
	<Treatments>
		<Treatment>Alleviation of symptoms</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Statin medications</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Dietary changes</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Surgery</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Anticoagulants like warfarin may actually promote arterial calcification in the long term, despite reducing clot formation in the short term.</Treatment>
