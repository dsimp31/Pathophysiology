	<Symptoms>
		<Symptom>Hyperuricemia</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Acute inflammatory arthritis, usually at the base of the big toe</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Acute inflammatory arthritis of heels, knees, wrists or fingers.</Symptom>

		<Symptom frequency="Uncommon">Fatigue</Symptom>

		<Symptom sname="Tophi">Hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Elevated uric acid levels may lead to crystals in kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent Urate Nephropathy</Symptom>

		<Diagnostic>X-Rays useful for chronic gout but not acute</Diagnostic>
		<Diagnostic>Microscopic examination of synovial fluid (or a tophus) for uric acid crystals.</Diagnostic>
		<Diagnostic>Blood plasma urate level greater than 420umol in males, 360umol in females.</Diagnostic>
