	<Symptoms>
		<Symptom>Stiff muscles</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Muscle twitching</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size</Symptom>
		<Symptom>Difficulty speaking, swallowing and/or breathing due to weakened muscles</Symptom>
	</Symptoms>
	<Causes>
		<Cause frequency="Majority">Unknown</Cause>
		<Cause frequency="Minority">Genetic</Cause>
		<Cause>A defect in chromosome 21 is associated with about 20% of cases</Cause>
	</Causes>
	<RiskFactors>
		<RiskFactor>First degree relatives of an individual with ALS have about a 1% risk of developing ALS</RiskFactor>
		<RiskFactor>Head injury</RiskFactor>
	</RiskFactors>
	<Diagnostics>
		<Diagnostic>Primarily based on observed signs and symptoms. No test can provide definitive diagnosis of ALS.</Diagnostic>
		<Diagnostic>Review of medical history, especially muscle weakness or atrophy, hyperreflexia, and spasticity.</Diagnostic>
	</Diagnostics>
	<Treatments>
		<Treatment>Riluzole has been found to modestly improve survival by 2-3 months.</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Breathing support via ventilatory assistance</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Physical therapy</Treatment>
		<Treatment>Nutrition and diet changes to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow</Treatment>
	</Treatments>
	<Prognoses>
		<Prognosis>No cure is known. A drug called riluzole may extend life by 2-3 months.</Prognosis>
		<Prognosis>Non-invasive ventilation may result in improved quality and length of life.</Prognosis>
	</Prognoses>
