	<Causes>
		<Cause type="Infective">Since the valves of the heart do not receive any dedicated blood supply, defensive immune mechanisms (such as white blood cells) cannot directly reach the valves via the bloodstream. If an organism (such as bacteria) attaches to a valve surface and forms a vegetation, the host immune response is blunted.</Cause>
		<Cause type="Infective">Rheumatic fever</Cause>
		<Cause type="Infective">Rheumatic heart disease</Cause>
		<Cause type="Non-infective">Can occur in patients with cancers or lupus</Cause>
